# Enhancing Your Policy Repository for Smart Matching

To turn your system into a true “policy-finder” for brokers—matching a customer’s needs (e.g., a 20,000 sq ft. supermarket in Pocono, PA) to available policies—you’ll need two pillars:  
1) Rich, structured metadata on each policy  
2) Powerful search/filter capabilities

## 1. Essential Policy Metadata

Capture these fields for every policy so it can be accurately matched:

| Field                          | Purpose                                                      |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Policy ID / SKU                | Unique identifier for lookup                                 |
| Carrier Name                   | “ABC Insurance Co.”                                          |
| Product Line                   | “Commercial Property,” “General Liability,” etc.             |
| Covered Property Types         | e.g., “Supermarket,” “Warehouse,” “Office”                   |
| Minimum/Maximum Property Size  | e.g., min = 10,000 sq ft., max = 50,000 sq ft.               |
| Geographic Coverage            | States/counties or ZIP codes served                          |
| Coverage Limits                | Per-occurrence and aggregate limits                          |
| Deductible Range               | Min and max deductible options                               |
| Premium Range                  | e.g., $1,000–$5,000 annually                                 |
| Policy Period                  | Start/end dates or term length                               |
| Perils Covered                 | Fire, Theft, Flood, Wind, Earthquake, etc.                   |
| Major Exclusions               | Flood, Cyber, Acts of God, etc.                              |
| Eligibility Criteria           | E.g., “No older than 20 years,” “Maximum occupancy 200”      |
| Underwriting Notes             | Any special underwriting restrictions or endorsements        |
| Document Link                  | URL to full policy PDF or summary                            |

## 2. Search & Filter Functionality

Design your UI/database queries to let brokers drill down on these dimensions:

- **Location**  
  - Filter by state, county, or ZIP code  
  - Radius search (e.g., within 50 miles of Pocono, PA)  

- **Property Size & Type**  
  - Numeric sliders: min/max sq ft.  
  - Checkboxes for property categories  

- **Coverage Needs**  
  - Perils toggles (fire, flood, theft, etc.)  
  - Coverage limit range selectors  

- **Price Band**  
  - Premium range input or preset tiers (Bronze/Silver/Gold)  

- **Deductible Options**  
  - Dropdown of standard deductible levels  

- **Advanced Filters**  
  - Eligibility flags (age of building, occupancy load)  
  - Carrier ratings or broker commissions  

---

## 3. UI/UX Considerations

- **Faceted Sidebar**  
  Show all filters at once; update results in real-time as brokers adjust sliders and checkboxes.  

- **Search Bar with Smart Suggestions**  
  Autocomplete “supermarket,” “warehouse,” “PA,” etc., pulling from your metadata.  

- **Results Grid or List**  
  Display key specs (carrier, premium band, limits) in columns; allow quick “Compare” checkboxes.  

- **Map View (Optional)**  
  Plot carrier service areas; let brokers zoom into specific regions.  

- **Save & Share**  
  Enable brokers to bookmark favorite policies and share links with colleagues.

By enriching each policy record with structured fields and pairing it with a faceted search UI, your brokerage tool will let users instantly surface the perfect policies for any customer scenario. Feel free to ask for code examples—database schemas, React components for filters, or CSS for your facets panel!
